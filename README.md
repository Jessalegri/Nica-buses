## Introduction
Welcome to the Nica Buses project! This initiative is dedicated to solving a critical challenge faced by residents and visitors in Nicaragua - accessing reliable bus schedules. Our goal is to simplify travel and enhance the transportation experience across the country.

## Problem Statement
In Nicaragua, the public bus network is extensive, yet there is a significant issue: the lack of accessible bus schedules. Currently, schedules are memorized by individuals and are not readily available to the public. This makes planning travel difficult and often leads to inefficiencies and inconvenience.

### The Challenge
- Inaccessibility: Bus schedules are not publicly available, requiring insider knowledge or local contacts to navigate the system.
- Lack of Centralization: There is no single, unified source for bus schedules across the country.
- Inefficiency: The current system relies heavily on word-of-mouth and human memory, leading to potential errors and outdated information.

## Our Solution: A Centralized Bus Schedule
Our project aims to create a user-friendly, centralized platform for bus schedules in Nicaragua. This platform will be:

- Centralized: Offering a single source for all bus schedules nationwide.
- Malleable: Easily updatable by users, ensuring that the information remains current and accurate.
- Accessible: Providing easy access to up-to-date bus schedules for everyone.

## Technology Stack
We've chosen specific technologies to build a robust and user-friendly application:

- HTML & CSS: For structuring and styling the web interface.
- JavaScript (JS): Chosen for its excellence in creating dynamic and interactive web applications.
- SQL: To manage and update the database effectively.

### Why JavaScript?
We opted for JavaScript over other languages and decided against using frameworks like React for the following reasons:

- Simplicity: Keeping the app straightforward and easy to use.
- Performance: Ensuring fast and responsive interactions.
- Flexibility: JavaScript's versatility makes it ideal for a wide range of features we plan to implement.

## Project Goals
Our primary objectives with the Nica Buses project are:

1. Enhance Accessibility: Make bus schedules easily available to all users.
2. Improve Efficiency: Reduce the reliance on memory and word-of-mouth for schedule information.
3. Foster Community Involvement: Enable users to contribute and update schedule information, ensuring accuracy and relevance.

## Conclusion
The Nica Buses project is more than just a technological endeavor; it's a community-driven solution to a longstanding problem in Nicaragua's public transportation system. By leveraging technology and community collaboration, we aim to transform the way people access and use bus schedules in the country.
